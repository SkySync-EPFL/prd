# Timeline/Resource Planning

### Overall Schedule:

The project is structured to move from an initial Minimum Viable Product (MVP) through multiple iterations based on real-world testing to a full product launch. The goal is to first validate the app's core functionality with a known hot-air balloon company that has shown interest. This phase is expected to last approximately 3-6 months, during which feedback will be continuously integrated into product development. Following successful MVP validation, the subsequent 6-12 months will focus on expanding the client base and scaling the application to handle increased demand.
