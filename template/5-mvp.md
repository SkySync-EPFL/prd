# The MVP

## Personas and Scenarios

**2. Usage:** Daily use for scheduling, real-time tracking, and post-flight reporting, enhancing operational efficiency and data-driven decision-making.

**3. Sharing:** Owners share success stories via industry forums, and pilots and ground crew recommend the app within their professional networks, expanding user adoption.

## Features Outside the Scope

### Non-Essential Features for MVP:

- **Advanced Analytics:** While more statistics about equipement usage, expenses and staff activities might help to further optimize the internal organisation and efficiency of each enterprise, basic anylitics suffice for initial stages without compromising the main utility of the app. More detailed analytics can be integrated after carefuly assesing what analytics are actually generally useful for the companies.

- **Customer Loyalty Programs:** Can be developed later as part of marketing enhancements to award loyality.

- **In-depth Customization Options:** Initially focus on standard solutions adaptable to the general hot-air balloon business and later allow for specific customizations and extensions that apply only to certain companies. Interesting extensions can be collected through feedback forms and then materialized once multiple companies share the same needs.
