### Description of V1 PoC as Planned by Sprint 10
As of the Sprint10, our POC has a lot of key features that are needed for the
final app. Theses includes:
* Users authenticate with Google.
* There are different user roles, including Admin, Pilot, and Crew, each with specific responsibilities
    * Admin: Plans flights, assigns equipment and team
    * Pilot: Can start and stop confirmetd flights to which they are assigned. Pilots can only start a flight on the day it is scheduled
    * Pilot and Crew: Can provide their availability using an integrated calendar.
* Users assigned to the same flight have access to a chat to faciliate communication during the flight 
* During a flight a map displays the location of all team members, the flight trace and metrics such as speed and altitude.
* Pilots and crew members are required to complete a report after each flight.
* Users will have access to cached data in offline mode but will be unable to modify it.

## What did we learn?
* How to handle tasks with dependencies.
* Team Organization: ensure that most tasks are completed by Thursday evening and establish a routine for standups.
* How to create small, preferably independent tasks from larger features
* How to build team spirit for a good communication between all members.

## Bridging the Gap from PoC to MVP
Some of the features that would be necessary to our final app would be:
* A weather widget to prepare for the day of flight
* Improved administrative statistics (salaries, employee working hours, etc.)
* More personalisation especially for the during flight map
* Notification to alert employees to flights assigned to them or new information on flights already assigned.
