# Analysis of the Situation

## Competing Products
Currently, hot-air balloon companies are using seperate tools for each aspect of their business and most of them aren't particularly well tailored to their needs.
A direct concurrence for our software solution is therefore almost non-inexistant. However, on some key features e.g. the map that shows the current position of an airborn balloon, there already exist some professional apps. We would therefore need to make our product on par with the technical features that we share with our competitors to make the transition to our all-in-one app smooth and appealing.

## Complementary Products
There are a few complementary products available that would enhance the experience for both operators and costumers:
- Weather Monitoring Tools, to see and adapt to the weather
- Payment Gateways, to facilitate secure and convenient payment processing of salaries.
- Marketing and Promotion Tools, to help the business promote its services and manage marketing campaigns.
- Analytics, to monitor the way the app is actually used by the users.
- Photography and Videography Services, to capture memorable moments during the balloon flight.
