# Analysis of the Situation

Currently, hot-air balloon companies are using seperate tools for each aspect of their business and some of them aren't even well tailored to their needs. 

Employees use google sheet to enter their availability, see which flights are scheduled and whether they have been assigned. As there is no notification of changes in the sheet, they have to check it regularly. 
WhatsApp is used for communication purposes, for example to enable administrators to provide information  to crew members, such details of flight preparations and take-off times. 
Pilots use several applications, as none of them is totally reliable, and each has its own strengths and weaknesses. For example, one application may provide accurate altitude and speed readings, but have a faulty position display, while another application may only display position without speed information.
Finally, crews and pilots are required to complete a report (via Google Forms) after the flight.

Since the hot-air balloon sector is a niche, there is currently no single application that meets all the needs of a hot-air balloon company. Direct competition is therefore minimal. However, there are professional applications for certain key functions, such as the in-flight map used to coordinate the balloon with crews. To ensure a smooth and attractive transition to our all-in-one application, we need to align ourselves with the technical aspects of these competitors.
